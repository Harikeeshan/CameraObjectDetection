CarbonMap object detection v0.1


This a feature of my app (CarbonMap) which allows user to scan an object and get an output of the carbon-footprint it makes on the enviroment.

This file is in storyboard and for future-proofing needs to re-written in SwiftUI. 
CoreML models are from https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models

Hope you find the project useful !!!
